`Lambda` and `StatefulLambda` are the primary way to write commands in
Mercurial.

These classes are immutable command builders, that allow you to compose a
command programmatically, and are easy to read and use.

`StatefulLambda` is the same as `Lambda`, but has additional state stored in it,
that gets passed to each of its methods to manipulate.

Both `Lambda` and `StatefulLambda` start with sensible defaults:
- no requirements
- an empty init method
- an empty execute method
- instantly finishes
- an empty end method
- is interruptible
- allowed to be scheduled in OpModeState.ACTIVE only (start and loop)

Then, you can apply the builder methods to compose a new command, by adding to
or replacing components of the current command.

# Construction
Both `Lambda` and `StatefulLambda` are easy to construct:
<CodeGroup>
```java Java
Lambda lambda = new Lamdba("command-name");
StatefulLambda<RefCell<String>> statefulLambda = new StatefulLambda<>("command-name", new RefCell<>("state"));
```
```kt Kotlin
val lambda = Lamdba("command-name")
val statefulLambda = StatefulLambda("command-name", RefCell("state"))
```
</CodeGroup>

Our `StatefulLambda` will have a `RefCell` with a `String` in it as its state.
Go read the `RefCell` documentation in Util for how it works. We need a cell or
similar in order to obtain interior mutability for a simpler piece of data like
a `String`, but you could use a more complex class you've written yourself.

# Building
There are easy methods to set parts of a Command:
<CodeGroup>
```java Java
lambda
	.setInit(() -> {
		// do w/e
	})
	.setExecute(() -> {
		// do w/e
	})
	.setEnd(interrupted -> {
		// do w/e
	})
	.setFinish(() -> {
		// compute and return if the command is finished
		return true;
	})
	// both variants are available
	.setInterruptible(true)
	.setInterruptible(() -> true)
	// we'll used Mercurial as an example requirement
	// but it would be strange to use
	// you could also pass a Set of objects instead of varargs
	.setRequirements(Mercurial.INSTANCE /*, varargs requirements*/)
	// you could also pass a Set of OpModeStates instead of varargs
	.setRunStates(OpModeState.INIT, OpModeState.ACTIVE);

statefulLambda
	// stateful lambda adds equivalent methods that also get state as a parameter
	.setExecute(stateRef -> {
		stateRef.accept("new state");
	})
	.setEnd((interrupted, stateRef) -> {
		if (interrupted) stateRef.accept("interrupted");
		else stateRef.accept("not interrupted");
	});
```
```kt Kotlin
lambda
	.setInit {
		// do w/e
	}
	.setExecute {
		// do w/e
	}
	.setEnd { interrupted ->
		// do w/e
	}
	.setFinish {
		// compute and return if the command is finished
		true
	}
	// both variants are available
	.setInterruptible(true)
	.setInterruptible { true }
	// we'll used Mercurial as an example requirement
	// but it would be strange to use
	// you could also pass a Set of objects instead of varargs
	.setRequirements(Mercurial, /*varargs requirements*/)
	// you could also pass a Set of OpModeStates instead of varargs
	.setRunStates(Wrapper.OpModeState.INIT, Wrapper.OpModeState.ACTIVE)

statefulLambda
	// stateful lambda adds equivalent methods that also get state as a parameter
	.setExecute { stateRef ->
		stateRef.accept("new state");
	}
	.setEnd { interrupted, stateRef ->
		if (interrupted) stateRef.accept("interrupted");
		else stateRef.accept("not interrupted");
	}
```
</CodeGroup>

Or add to the pre-existing ones, we'll demonstrate some of the add methods, but
there are equivalents for all the set methods.
<CodeGroup>
```java Java
lambda
	.addInit(() -> {
		// this will run the init already set
		// then this code
	})
	.addFinish(finished -> {
		// addFinished gives you the computed finished state of the command thus far
		// and allows you to then determine if it should still finish
		return finished;
	})
	.addInterruptible(interruptible -> {
		// addInterruptible does the same
		return interruptible;
	});

statefulLambda
	// statefulLambda has all the same methods, plus you can get the state
	.addInterruptible((interruptible, state) -> {
		return interruptible && state.get().equals("interruptible");
	});
```
```kt Kotlin
lambda
	.addInit {
		// this will run the init already set
		// then this code
	}
	.addFinish { finished ->
		// addFinished gives you the computed finished state of the command thus far
		// and allows you to then determine if it should still finish
		finished
	}
	.addInterruptible { interruptible ->
		// addInterruptible does the same
		interruptible
	}

statefulLambda
	// statefulLambda has all the same methods, plus you can get the state
	.addInterruptible { interruptible, state ->
		interruptible && state.get() == "interruptible"
	}
```
</CodeGroup>

Remember, each of these methods are non-mutating. This means than when you call
them, you get back a new, different command. In the case of statefulLambda, they
still share the same state reference, but other than that they are totally
different.

This is a common theme across Dairy, and its not hard to deal with, but you must
keep it in mind.

Finally, any command can be converted into a `Lambda` or `StatefulLambda`
command.
<CodeGroup>
```java Java
Lambda converted = Lambda.from(new Sequential())
	.addEnd(interrupted -> {
		System.out.println("sequence ending, interrupted: " + interrupted + "!");
	});

StatefulLambda<RefCell<Integer>> statefulConverted = StatefulLambda.from(new Sequential(), new RefCell<>(0))
	.addEnd((interrupted, stateRef) -> {
		// increment state
		stateRef.accept(stateRef.get() + 1);
		System.out.println("sequence ending for the " + stateRef.get() + " time, interrupted: " + interrupted + "!");
	});
```
```kt Kotlin
val converted: Lambda = Lambda.from(Sequential())
	.addEnd {
		println("sequence ending!")
	}

val statefulConverted: StatefulLambda<RefCell<Int>> = StatefulLambda.from(Sequential(), RefCell(0))
	.addEnd { interrupted, stateRef ->
		// increment state
		stateRef.accept(stateRef.get() + 1)
		println("sequence ending for the ${stateRef.get()} time, interrupted: $interrupted!")
	}
```
</CodeGroup>

This process is safe for `Lambda.from(Command)`, it does not create a new object
if the argument is already a `Lambda` or a `StatefulLambda`.

But `StatefulLamba.from(Command, STATE)` does not have this safety.

`Lambda` and `StatefulLambda` are clearly nice and easy ways to compose
commands! They are the recommended tool for writing commands in Mercurial.
