The `Dependency` system is complex and powerful.

A `Dependency` declares rules for when a `Feature` should receive updates about
an OpMode.

The overview file from the examples is perfect at looking at all the features
for `Dependency` and the built in utilities. If you're going to write a
`Feature` its best that you take a look at the full capabilities of the
`Dependency` system, as the examples so far have used only a small subset of its
capabilities.
