title: OpMode Templating
---
OpMode templating the usage of inheritance and super classes to reuse things
like annotations and `OpModeLazyCell`s in OpModes.

OpMode templating is an alternative to writing a `RobotHardware` class / file,
that scales better through your usage of Dairy than using one would, because it
supports the reuse of Features that are enabled via annotation.

# What is a `RobotHardware` file?
<Note>
	I can no-longer find the article that I once read on gm0, as such, it is
	not linked here.
</Note>
I first came across this concept while reading a game manual 0 article during my
first season of programming for FTC. While by the time I had finished with the
season I was writing the previous version of the Mercurial library that some
might be familiar with, and had moved far beyond this concept, I still think it
was a useful construct to introduce me to the basic ideas of writing reusable
FTC code. Additionally, I continue to see teams employing the idea either as a
`RobotHardware` or `Robot` class, even when they have more powerful and flexible
tools already in use in their code! and it lead me down a path of trying (and
failing) several different ways to write reusable robot code in FTC.

The `RobotHardware` class serves the purpose of collecting all of your common
robot setup code into one place, which is then reused across all OpModes.

Advantages:
- Much better than duplicating code across OpModes.
- Allows for complex reusable methods and functions to allow for common complex
  control to be reused as well.
- With some work, allows for automatic management of systems that require
  frequent updates, like control loops.

Disadvantages:
- Inflexible, you can't pick and choose parts you want.
- Requires some boiler plate for each OpMode, but this could be avoided using
  Dairy `Feature`s.
- Gets bloated with needing to handle a whole bunch of logic for a whole bunch
  of systems.

In general, I advise for using subsystems, whether through a command based
library like FTClib or Dairy's Mercurial, or by writing them yourself (Mercurial
just thinly wraps over Dairy `Feature`s, and adds some tools for using them with
Mercurial, so its easy to create your own).

However, there is a great deal of merit in the reason that teams using
subsystems were still using one. They didn't want to repeat that boilerplate of
setting up their subsystems! So lets take a look at OpMode templating, an
alternate approach that supports reducing the boilerplate of Dairy annotations,
and supports the reducing the boilerplate of hardware.

A template:
<CodeGroup>
```java Java
// lets add that BulkRead feature from Writing + Using Features
@BulkReads.Attach
public abstract class Template extends OpMode {
	// lets add OpModeLazyCells for each hardware item
	private final OpModeLazyCell<DcMotorEx> leftFront
			= new OpModeLazyCell<>(() -> hardwareMap.get(DcMotorEx.class, "lf"));
	private final OpModeLazyCell<DcMotorEx> leftBack
			= new OpModeLazyCell<>(() -> hardwareMap.get(DcMotorEx.class, "lb"));
	// right motors need some additional setup
	private final OpModeLazyCell<DcMotorEx> rightBack = new OpModeLazyCell<>(() -> {
		DcMotorEx m = hardwareMap.get(DcMotorEx.class, "rb");
		m.setDirection(DcMotorSimple.Direction.REVERSE);
		return m;
	});
	private final OpModeLazyCell<DcMotorEx> rightFront = new OpModeLazyCell<>(() -> {
		DcMotorEx m = hardwareMap.get(DcMotorEx.class, "rf");
		m.setDirection(DcMotorSimple.Direction.REVERSE);
		return m;
	});

	// and lets add getters to access the cells
	public DcMotorEx getLeftFront() { return leftFront.get(); }
	public DcMotorEx getLeftBack() { return leftBack.get(); }
	public DcMotorEx getRightBack() { return rightBack.get(); }
	public DcMotorEx getRightFront() { return rightFront.get(); }
}
```
```kt Kotlin
// lets add that BulkRead feature from Writing + Using Features
@BulkReads.Attach
abstract class Template : OpMode() {
	// lets add OpModeLazyCells for each hardware item
	val leftFront: DcMotorEx by OpModeLazyCell {
		hardwareMap.get(
			DcMotorEx::class.java, "lf"
		)
	}
	val leftBack: DcMotorEx by OpModeLazyCell {
		hardwareMap.get(
			DcMotorEx::class.java, "lb"
		)
	}

	// right motors need some additional setup
	val rightBack: DcMotorEx by OpModeLazyCell {
		val m = hardwareMap.get(DcMotorEx::class.java, "rb")
		m.direction = DcMotorSimple.Direction.REVERSE
		m
	}
	val rightFront: DcMotorEx by OpModeLazyCell {
		val m = hardwareMap.get(DcMotorEx::class.java, "rf")
		m.direction = DcMotorSimple.Direction.REVERSE
		m
	}
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Using it:
<CodeGroup>
```java Java
// we don't need to add the @BulkReads.Attach annotation
public class Usage extends Template {
	@Override
	public void init() {
	}
	@Override
	public void loop() {
		// and we can access the methods from the Template
		// thanks to OpModeLazyCell, the motors will be initialised in init
		// rather than impact our first loop later
		getLeftFront().setPower(-gamepad1.left_stick_y);
		getLeftBack().setPower(-gamepad1.left_stick_y);
		getRightBack().setPower(-gamepad1.left_stick_y);
		getRightFront().setPower(-gamepad1.left_stick_y);
	}
}
```
```kt Kotlin
// we don't need to add the @BulkReads.Attach annotation
class Usage : Template() {
	override fun init() {
	}

	override fun loop() {
		// and we can access the methods from the Template
		// thanks to OpModeLazyCell, the motors will be initialised in init
		// rather than impact our first loop later
		leftFront.power = -gamepad1.left_stick_y.toDouble()
		leftBack.power = -gamepad1.left_stick_y.toDouble()
		rightBack.power = -gamepad1.right_stick_y.toDouble()
		rightFront.power = -gamepad1.right_stick_y.toDouble()
	}
}
```
</CodeGroup>

We saved ourselves needing to re-write that annotation, or setup that hardware
again.

Take a look at the examples for a more advanced version of the same thing.
