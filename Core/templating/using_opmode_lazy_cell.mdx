title: Using OpModeLazyCell
---

`OpModeLazyCell` and `OpModeFreshCell` are both cells that use features from
both `LazyCell` in Util and features from Dairy Core.

`OpModeLazyCell` is a LazyCell that gets *eagerly* evaluated via a preInit hook.

This means that you can put hardware initialisation in an `OpModeLazyCell` and
separate out your init phase, while its still safe to use the contents of the
cell at any point after init starts.

`OpModeLazyCell` `deregister`s after the OpMode runs, but `OpModeFreshCell` does
not, so if you need your cell to be reinstantiated every OpMode then you can use
`OpModeFreshCell`, which is exactly the same, but does not exhibit the automatic
`deregister`ing behaviour.

This will be demonstrated when looking further at templating!

As with all Cells, `OpModeLazyCell` and `OpModeFreshCell` can be used for
delegation in Kotlin.
