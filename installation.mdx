As Dairy is not a single library, each Dairy module will give its own
instructions on installation, what other things you need to add, etc.

# Using Snapshots

The per-module instructions in these docs are instructions on how to install
from Dairy's releases repository. You may wish to use snapshots if you wish to
test unreleased features, or if you've asked for a specific fix to be applied to
the library, and you need to use it immediately.

All Dairy module installation instructions tell you to start by ensuring that
you have the Dairy repository added as a source:

<Info>
This only needs to be done once, if you already have this, no need to add it
again.
</Info>

Add

```gradle
repositories {
	maven {
		url "https://repo.dairy.foundation/releases"
	}
}
```

To `TeamCode`'s `build.gradle`, above `dependencies`.

You can then also add snapshots to this, as you would any other maven repository:

```gradle
repositories {
	maven {
		url "https://repo.dairy.foundation/releases"
	}
	maven {
		url "https://repo.dairy.foundation/snapshots"
	}
}
```
