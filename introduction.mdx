Dairy is an ecosystem of open source FTC libraries.

Dairy's libraries are designed to be fairly pick and choose, allowing users to
use what they want from the system, but at the same time, where Dairy offers
something, it should be tightly integrated with the rest of the system, and
should be the best solution available.

Dairy is written in a way that balances nicely written and easy to use apis with
the ability for a more advanced user to make use of the extesibility, or write a
library of their own.

These docs are meant to be read alongside examples and overviews provided in the
[TeamCode module of the Dairy
monorepo](https://github.com/Dairy-Foundation/Dairy/tree/master/TeamCode/src/main).

Dairy is written entirely in Kotlin, but provides examples and documentation in
both Kotlin and Java. Dairy is nicer to use in Kotlin, and if you feel somewhat
confident in your Java skills, then I think its [worth giving Kotlin a
try!](https://cookbook.dairy.foundation/misc/why_kotlin/why_kotlin.html)
