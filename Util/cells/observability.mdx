`Observable`s support the ability to bind `Observer`s to them. `Observer`s receive an
update when the contents of the cell change. `Observerable`s are both
`Observable`s `Observer`s.

Cells are `Observerable`, which means you can chain them to each other to
publish and receive updates about changes in cell content.

Lets take a quick look:
<CodeGroup>
```java Java
RefCell<String> c1 = new RefCell<>("start");
RefCell<String> c2 = new RefCell<>("");
// c2 will now receive updates about changes to c1
// immediately after binding, c1 will update c2
c1.bind(c2);
// now c2 will contain "start"
c1.accept("end");
// now c2 will contain "end"
```
```kt Kotlin
val c1 = RefCell("start")
val c2 = RefCell("")
// c2 will now receive updates about changes to c1
// immediately after binding, c1 will update c2
c1.bind(c2)
// now c2 will contain "start"
c1.accept("end")
// now c2 will contain "end"
```
</CodeGroup>

Two-way binds are also supported for `Observerable`s (which cells are):
<CodeGroup>
```java Java
RefCell<String> c1 = new RefCell<>("start");
RefCell<String> c2 = new RefCell<>("");
// c2 will now receive updates about changes to c1
// and c1 will now receive updates about changes to c2
// c1 will bind c2 first
// so c1 will update c2 first
c1.bindBoth(c2);
// now c2 will contain "start"
c1.accept("end");
// now c2 will contain "end"
c2.accept("");
// now c1 will contain ""
```
```kt Kotlin
val c1 = RefCell("start")
val c2 = RefCell("")
// c2 will now receive updates about changes to c1
// and c1 will now receive updates about changes to c2
// c1 will bind c2 first
// so c1 will update c2 first
c1.bindBoth(c2)
// now c2 will contain "start"
c1.accept("end")
// now c2 will contain "end"
c2.accept("")
// now c1 will contain ""
```
</CodeGroup>

Lets look at what `Observer`s actually are:
<CodeGroup>
```java Java
RefCell<String> c1 = new RefCell<>("start");
c1.bind(incoming -> {
	System.out.println(incoming);
})
// "start" will be printed
c1.accept("end");
// now "end" will be printed
```
```kt Kotlin
val c1 = RefCell("start")
c1.bind {
	println(it)
}
// "start" will be printed
c1.accept("end")
// now "end" will be printed
```
</CodeGroup>

They're just a functional interface, this means you can use them for whatever
you'd like, not just binding cells together.

Bindings involving LateInitCells and derivatives are fine between each-other,
but bindings between LateInitCells and RefCells of a *non*-nullable type get
complex.

Knowing that `Observer`s are just functional interfaces, lets solve the issues
that arise when binding nullable to non-nullable cells.

<CodeGroup>
```java Java
RefCell<String> c1 = new RefCell<>("start");
LateInitCell<String> c2 = new LateInitCell<>();

c1.bind(c2);
// now c2 contains "start"

// this bind won't run if the arg is null
c2.bind(incoming -> {
	// don't update if the incoming data is null
	if (incoming == null) return;
	// update is like accept for observers
	c1.update(incoming);
});

c2.accept("end");
// now c1 contains "end"

c2.invalidate();
// now c2 contains null, while c1 still contains "end"
```
```kt Kotlin
val c1 = RefCell("start")
val c2 = LateInitCell<String>()

c1.bind(c2)
// now c2 contains "start"

// this bind won't run if the arg is null
c2.bind {
	// update is like accept for observers
	// don't update if the incoming data is null
	c1.update(it ?: return@bind)
}

c2.accept("end")
// now c1 contains "end"

c2.invalidate()
// now c2 contains null, while c1 still contains "end"
```
</CodeGroup>

`Observers` can also be unbound:
<CodeGroup>
```java Java
RefCell<String> c1 = new RefCell<>("start");
RefCell<String> c2 = new RefCell<>("");
// c2 will now receive updates about changes to c1
// immediately after binding, c1 will update c2
c1.bind(c2);

// undoes that
// returns true if c2 was bound to c1
c1.unbind(c2);

c1.bindBoth(c2);

// unbindBoth also exists,
// unbinds both c2 from c1,
// and c1 from c2.
// returns true if either c2 was bound to c1, or c1 was bound to c2
c1.unbindBoth(c2);
```
```kt Kotlin
val c1 = RefCell("start")
val c2 = RefCell("")
// c2 will now receive updates about changes to c1
// immediately after binding, c1 will update c2
c1.bind(c2)

// undoes that
// returns true if c2 was bound to c1
c1.unbind(c2)

c1.bindBoth(c2)

// unbindBoth also exists,
// unbinds both c2 from c1,
// and c1 from c2.
// returns true if either c2 was bound to c1, or c1 was bound to c2
c1.unbindBoth(c2)
```
</CodeGroup>

Cool, that's all for observability for now.
