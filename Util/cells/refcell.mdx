title: Intro to Cells + RefCell
---
Cells are Dairy's shared interior mutability reference wrapper.
This sounds complicated, but its not.
Cells basically allow you to wrap some data with a common access interface.

The most basic cell you could use is the `RefCell`. We'll use [Units](./units)
as our inner contents.
<CodeGroup>
```java Java
RefCell<Distance> millimeters = new RefCell<>(Distances.mm(10)); // this RefCell contains a Distance
```
```kt Kotlin
val millimeters = RefCell(10.mm) // this RefCell contains a Distance
```
</CodeGroup>

The contents of a Cell are often referred to as the 'contents' or the 'ref'
(short for reference).
We can access the contents like so:

<CodeGroup>
```java Java
Distance ten = millimeters.get();
```
```kt Kotlin
val ten = millimeters.get()
```
</CodeGroup>

and we can set the contents like so:

<CodeGroup>
```java Java
millimeters.accept(Distances.mm(12));
```
```kt Kotlin
millimeters.accept(12.mm)
```
</CodeGroup>

This is because all Cells implement Consumer and Supplier.
This allows them to be used directly in many places across Dairy, as these two
interfaces are used often.

Additionally, Cells keep track of when access occurred.

<CodeGroup>
```java Java
double secondsGet = millimeters.getTimeSincelastGet();
double secondsSet = millimeters.getTimeSincelastSet();
double secondsAccess = millimeters.getTimeSinceLastAccess();
```
```kt Kotlin
val secondsGet: Double = millimeters.timeSincelastGet
val secondsSet: Double = millimeters.timeSincelastSet
val secondsAccess: Double = millimeters.timeSinceLastAccess
```
</CodeGroup>

Its also worth noting that Cells can be used for delegation in Kotlin:
<CodeGroup>
```java Java
public Distance getDistance() {
	return millimeters.get();
}
public void setDistance(Distance distance) {
	millimeters.accept(distance);
}
```
```kt Kotlin
val distance by millimeters
```
</CodeGroup>
This means that `distance` is of type `Distance`, and when you get, or set it,
the behaviour is delegated to the millimeters RefCell.

RefCell is useful, but Cells can be extended to have a myriad of other
behaviours, we'll go over some of the more common and useful
