title: Other Cells
---
Additional Cells exist, but are likely not so useful to the more common user.
- `MirroredCell` - for reflection
- `WeakCell` - for WeakReferences
- `AtomicCell` - for AtomicReferences
- `CollectionCell` - acts as a Collection

It is also possible to implement your own cells, this should be done by either
subclassing `RefCell` or `LateInitCell`, or one of their subtypes.

If using Core or beyond, you should look at the Cells defined in those modules.
