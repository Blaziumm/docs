title: LateInitCell and Derivatives
---
LateInitCell starts with null inside, but insists that it doesn't contain a null
value! It will throw an exception if you try to get the contents and they are
null.

The next cells are all built off the LateInitCell back, so they all share the
following additional utility methods:

<CodeGroup>
```java Java
LateInitCell<Distance> late = new LateInitCell<>();
// attempting to get the data out now would throw an error
late.accept(Distances.mm(10));
late.getInitialised(); // true
// late.accept(null); this doesn't work
late.invalidate(); // now the cell is back to containing null
late.getInitialised(); // false
late.safeGet(); // will not throw an error if the contents are null
late.safeInvoke(ref -> { // only runs if the contents aren't null
   return ref.plus(Distances.mm(12));
}); // null
```
```kt Kotlin
val late = LateInitCell<Distance>()
// attempting to get the data out now would throw an error
late.accept(10.mm)
late.initialised // true
// late.accept(null) this doesn't work
late.invalidate() // now the cell is back to containing null
late.initialised // false
late.safeGet() // will not throw an error if the contents are null
late.safeInvoke { // only runs if the contents aren't null
    it + 12.mm
} // null
```
</CodeGroup>

# LazyCell

LazyCell will lazily evaluate its contents from a function whenever you attempt
to obtain the contents and they are null.

Combine this with `invalidate()` in order to re-evaluate the contents using the
function.

Several modules have their own wrapper of this, e.g. Core has the
`OpModeLazyCell` and `OpModeFreshLazyCell` and Mercurial has the
`SubsytemObjectCell`. These wrappers provide additional functionality tied to
their specific domains.

<CodeGroup>
```java Java
// counter must be a field, not a local variable
int counter = 0;
LazyCell<Distance> lazy = new LazyCell<>(() -> {
	return Distances.mm(++counter);
});

lazy.get(); // now counter is 1, this is equivalent in mm
lazy.get(); // still 1
lazy.invalidate();
lazy.get(); // now counter is 2
lazy.get(); // still 2
```
```kt Kotlin
// counter must be a field, not a local variable
var counter = 0;
val lazy = LazyCell {
    (++counter).mm
}

lazy.get() // now counter is 1, this is equivalent in mm
lazy.get() // still 1
lazy.invalidate()
lazy.get() // now counter is 2
lazy.get() // still 2
```
</CodeGroup>

# InvalidatingCell

Invalidating Cell is like lazy cell, but has a built in self invalidation
function as well.

<CodeGroup>
```java Java
InvalidatingCell<Distance> invalidating = new InvalidatingCell<>(() -> {
	return Distances.mm(++counter);
}, (self, contents) -> {
	return contents.lessThan(Distances.mm(10)) || self.getTimeSincelastSet() > 1;
});
```
```kt Kotlin
val invalidating = InvalidatingCell({
	(++counter).mm
}, { self, contents ->
	contents < 10.mm || self.timeSincelastSet > 1
})
```
</CodeGroup>

Whenever the contents of the cell are accessed, the invalidating function is
checked, to see if the cell should be re-evaluated.

The cell contents should not be accessed through the `self` parameter, as this
will cause stack overflow, this is what the `contents` parameter is for.

## StaleAccessCell

A time-based wrapper for InvalidatingCell.

<CodeGroup>
```java Java
StaleAccessCell<Distance> staleAccess = new StaleAccessCell<>(5.1, () -> {
	return Distances.mm(++counter);
});
```
```kt Kotlin
val staleAccess = StaleAccessCell(5.1) {
	(++counter).mm
}
```
</CodeGroup>

This example will invalidate when it has been 5.1 seconds since last access.

## StaleEvalCell

A time-based wrapper for InvalidatingCell

<CodeGroup>
```java Java
StaleEvalCell<Distance> staleEval = new StaleEvalCell<>(5.1, () -> {
	return Distances.mm(++counter);
});
```
```kt Kotlin
val staleEval = StaleEvalCell(5.1) {
	(++counter).mm
}
```
</CodeGroup>

This example will invalidate when it has been 5.1 seconds since last eval.
