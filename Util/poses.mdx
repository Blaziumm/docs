Poses are similar to vectors, a useful multidimensional data structure.

Dairy supports `DoublePose2D` and `DistancePose2D`.

We'll look at `DistancePose2D`, but `DoublePose2D` is super similar, outside
of a couple of `Distance` specific utility methods.

<CodeGroup>
```java Java
DistancePose2D pose = new DistancePose2D(DistanceVector2Ds.millimeterVector(10, 10), Angles.relativeDeg(90));

// OR

DistancePose2Ds.millimeterPose(10, 10, Angles.relativeDeg(90));

DistanceVector2D vector = pose.getVector2D();
Angle heading = pose.getHeading();
```
```kt Kotlin
val pose = DistancePose2D(millimeterVector(10.0, 10.0), 90.relativeDeg)
// OR
millimeterPose(10.0, 10.0, 90.relativeDeg)
pose.vector2D
pose.heading

val (vector, heading) = pose
```
</CodeGroup>

That's the basics! In Kotlin, we also get that cool destructuring to `vector` and
`heading`.

Poses also have all expected mathematical operations defined on them: plus
another pose, plus a vector, plus a heading, minus another pose, minus a
vector, minus a heading, unaryPlus, unaryMinus, times by scalar, div by scalar.
Take a look back at `Distance`s in the `Unit` section to review this. The only
operations not defined here is `mod` or `rem`, as well as times and div by other
poses or vectors.

Poses don't have any specific utilities, other than for doing intos for the
`heading` `Angle`, which we won't look at, as we've already reviewed these
looking at `Angles`s themselves.

`DistancePose2D`s also have utilities for working with the `DistanceUnit`s of
the `DistanceVector2D` it stores.

<CodeGroup>
```java Java
// converts x to FOOT, y to CENTIMETER
pose.into(DistanceUnits.FOOT, DistanceUnits.CENTIMETER);
// converts both x and y to FOOT
pose.into(DistanceUnits.FOOT);

pose.intoMillimeters();
pose.intoCentimeters();
pose.intoMeters();
pose.intoInches();
pose.intoFeet();
```
```kt Kotlin
// converts x to FOOT, y to CENTIMETER
pose.into(DistanceUnits.FOOT, DistanceUnits.CENTIMETER)
// converts both x and y to FOOT
pose.into(DistanceUnits.FOOT)

pose.intoMillimeters()
pose.intoCentimeters()
pose.intoMeters()
pose.intoInches()
pose.intoFeet()
```
