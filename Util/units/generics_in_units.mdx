At the start of looking at units, we looked at `Unit<U : Unit<U>>` and
`ReifiedUnit<U: Unit<U>, RU: ReifiedUnit<U, RU>>`.

Lets take a second look at why these are needed, and why they work.

Firstly, these generics allow for generic family lock-in, basically, code can be
written that is generic across all of `RU: ReifiedUnit<U, RU>`, and once you use
a specific unit there, nothing else can be used, by using `RU` rather than just
`ReifiedUnit<U: Unit>`, we ensure that __only__ `Distance`s can be used, as
opposed to any `ReifiedUnit<DistanceUnit>`, which means we can rely on the
properties and functions of `Distance`. The same applies for `Unit<U: Unit<U>>`.
We use this cycle to define a family, like `DistanceUnit` which extends
`Unit<DistanceUnit>`, this means that `DistanceUnit` needs to be able to handle
conversion between itself and any other `DistanceUnit` but not any `Unit`.

This is a fairly complex usage of generics and type systems, so don't worry if
you don't get it.

The basic idea, is that we can write code that works for any '`RU`' or '`U`' and
guarantee that it locks to that one, once its used.
