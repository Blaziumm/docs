Dairy offers a type safe unit system. There are three types of units offered
throughout Dairy: `Distance`,`Angle`, and `Current`.

Why?
1. The type system usage means that code can be written to handle any Unit, and
   then get locked to that Unit's family. This allows users to pass any Unit in
   the same family where a family is specified (e.g. centimeters, inches, or
   meters could all be used in the same place).
2. The user is safe from accidentally using a unit from a different family once
   one is locked to (e.g, you can't pass an `Angle` where a `Distance` is
   expected)
3. The user can quickly convert units within the family.
4. The user can easily define their own units of the same family for their
   specific use-case.
5. Units are designed with no mutating operations, which means users never need
   to worry about the contents of the unit changing.

# Types

Dairy comes with these units defined.

## `Distance`
- Linear distances.
- Comes built in with:
	- Metric units (mm, cm, m).
	- Imperial units (in, ft).

## `Angle`
- Linear and wrapping angles.
- Comes built in with:
	- Radians and degrees.
	- Wrapping (domain limits, specified here in rotations) linear `(-inf,
	  inf)`, wrapping `[0, 0.5)`, and relative `[-0.5, 0.5)`.
- Automatically converts to linear when linear is involved on either side of the
  equation, otherwise, preferences the left side of the equation.

## `Current`
- Amperage.
- Comes built in with:
	- Amps, Milliamps.

# Units and ReifiedUnits

Dairy's unit system is comprised of two parts. We'll look at their full generic
signature here, but we won't worry about what it means too much for this level
of documentation.

1. `Unit<U: Unit<U>>`

This is like the concept of a unit, like "Meter", "Inch", and describes the
mathematical relationship between these concepts, within the same family. `Unit`
is an interface, which means its easy to subclass it, and implement it in enums.

We use `Unit` to define families of units.

i.e. Dairy has `DistanceUnit` and `AngleUnit` as families for `Distance` and
`Angle` respectively.

`Unit` is used to define some common maths to enable conversion between
different units in the same family, and makes it easy to define your own units
in pre-existing families.

2. `ReifiedUnit<U: Unit<U>, RU: ReifiedUnit<U, RU>>`

If `Unit` was our concept of a unit, then `ReifiedUnit` is an actual value,
measured by our `Unit`.

This is a combination of a value, and a specific unit in a unit family.

i.e. `Distance` extends `ReifiedUnit<DistanceUnit, Distance>`

So `10 mm` is a `Distance`!
It has:
- a `value` of 10
- a `unit` of `millimeters`

`ReifiedUnit` is what we'll work with most, and so the remainder of this page
will look at `Distance` and `Angle`
